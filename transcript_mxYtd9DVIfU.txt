[00:00:03.270] Everyone is wrong about crypto in 2025.
[00:00:03.280] Everyone is wrong about crypto in 2025. And I mean it. The crowd is wrong in a
[00:00:05.110] And I mean it. The crowd is wrong in a
[00:00:05.120] And I mean it. The crowd is wrong in a huge way that will result in a lot of
[00:00:06.550] huge way that will result in a lot of
[00:00:06.560] huge way that will result in a lot of traders and a lot of investors getting
[00:00:08.310] traders and a lot of investors getting
[00:00:08.320] traders and a lot of investors getting caught with their pants down, which is
[00:00:10.629] caught with their pants down, which is
[00:00:10.639] caught with their pants down, which is never a good time, is it? Over the next
[00:00:12.549] never a good time, is it? Over the next
[00:00:12.559] never a good time, is it? Over the next couple of years, things could get a lot
[00:00:14.390] couple of years, things could get a lot
[00:00:14.400] couple of years, things could get a lot crazier than people think. But the clues
[00:00:16.230] crazier than people think. But the clues
[00:00:16.240] crazier than people think. But the clues are all there for anyone who takes the
[00:00:18.230] are all there for anyone who takes the
[00:00:18.240] are all there for anyone who takes the time to look around. Plus, good
[00:00:20.630] time to look around. Plus, good
[00:00:20.640] time to look around. Plus, good oldfashioned market psychology is
[00:00:23.269] oldfashioned market psychology is
[00:00:23.279] oldfashioned market psychology is actually offering up some pretty
[00:00:25.029] actually offering up some pretty
[00:00:25.039] actually offering up some pretty interesting hints about what's really
[00:00:27.029] interesting hints about what's really
[00:00:27.039] interesting hints about what's really going on under the hood. So, let's get
[00:00:29.269] going on under the hood. So, let's get
[00:00:29.279] going on under the hood. So, let's get into it. look at how and why everyone
[00:00:33.590] into it. look at how and why everyone
[00:00:33.600] into it. look at how and why everyone might be wrong. So, first it's clear
[00:00:35.590] might be wrong. So, first it's clear
[00:00:35.600] might be wrong. So, first it's clear that the crypto goalposts just keep
[00:00:39.030] that the crypto goalposts just keep
[00:00:39.040] that the crypto goalposts just keep moving. And what I mean is that this
[00:00:41.590] moving. And what I mean is that this
[00:00:41.600] moving. And what I mean is that this cycle has been a little bit offkilter.
[00:00:44.470] cycle has been a little bit offkilter.
[00:00:44.480] cycle has been a little bit offkilter. Things haven't gone as planned with the
[00:00:46.790] Things haven't gone as planned with the
[00:00:46.800] Things haven't gone as planned with the four-year cycle. People been calling
[00:00:48.310] four-year cycle. People been calling
[00:00:48.320] four-year cycle. People been calling tops the whole way through. We got new
[00:00:50.229] tops the whole way through. We got new
[00:00:50.239] tops the whole way through. We got new highs before the Bitcoin having the
[00:00:52.229] highs before the Bitcoin having the
[00:00:52.239] highs before the Bitcoin having the game's changed. The cycle top was
[00:00:54.549] game's changed. The cycle top was
[00:00:54.559] game's changed. The cycle top was supposedly in early just because the
[00:00:56.310] supposedly in early just because the
[00:00:56.320] supposedly in early just because the ETFs launched and nothing could beat
[00:00:58.229] ETFs launched and nothing could beat
[00:00:58.239] ETFs launched and nothing could beat that, right? Well, then it was, well,
[00:01:00.950] that, right? Well, then it was, well,
[00:01:00.960] that, right? Well, then it was, well, new all-time high in March 2024. Well,
[00:01:04.789] new all-time high in March 2024. Well,
[00:01:04.799] new all-time high in March 2024. Well, that was going to end the cycle. It was
[00:01:06.789] that was going to end the cycle. It was
[00:01:06.799] that was going to end the cycle. It was over then. Do you remember those calls?
[00:01:08.230] over then. Do you remember those calls?
[00:01:08.240] over then. Do you remember those calls? I remember those calls. Then it's
[00:01:09.750] I remember those calls. Then it's
[00:01:09.760] I remember those calls. Then it's because, well, Trump got inaugurated and
[00:01:11.910] because, well, Trump got inaugurated and
[00:01:11.920] because, well, Trump got inaugurated and the Trump pump is over, baby. It's all
[00:01:13.750] the Trump pump is over, baby. It's all
[00:01:13.760] the Trump pump is over, baby. It's all done. Trump tariffs are here. We're
[00:01:15.109] done. Trump tariffs are here. We're
[00:01:15.119] done. Trump tariffs are here. We're going to zero. Okay. 100K, we need to
[00:01:17.510] going to zero. Okay. 100K, we need to
[00:01:17.520] going to zero. Okay. 100K, we need to pack it up because that level is the
[00:01:18.870] pack it up because that level is the
[00:01:18.880] pack it up because that level is the psychological barrier. Then 100 go.
[00:01:21.030] psychological barrier. Then 100 go.
[00:01:21.040] psychological barrier. Then 100 go. 120K. I was the top now. We see this
[00:01:23.429] 120K. I was the top now. We see this
[00:01:23.439] 120K. I was the top now. We see this reason and that reason. Of course, all
[00:01:25.270] reason and that reason. Of course, all
[00:01:25.280] reason and that reason. Of course, all of those calls have been wrong. People
[00:01:27.670] of those calls have been wrong. People
[00:01:27.680] of those calls have been wrong. People keep fading. what's happening. The
[00:01:29.429] keep fading. what's happening. The
[00:01:29.439] keep fading. what's happening. The institutional bid is here now. We could
[00:01:31.990] institutional bid is here now. We could
[00:01:32.000] institutional bid is here now. We could discuss at great length why everyone has
[00:01:34.310] discuss at great length why everyone has
[00:01:34.320] discuss at great length why everyone has been so cynical this time around. And I
[00:01:35.830] been so cynical this time around. And I
[00:01:35.840] been so cynical this time around. And I think a lot of it comes down to PTSD,
[00:01:37.590] think a lot of it comes down to PTSD,
[00:01:37.600] think a lot of it comes down to PTSD, deep scars from the FTX and all the
[00:01:39.910] deep scars from the FTX and all the
[00:01:39.920] deep scars from the FTX and all the other scams that happened in the market
[00:01:41.350] other scams that happened in the market
[00:01:41.360] other scams that happened in the market in 2022, which was especially harsh. Or
[00:01:44.069] in 2022, which was especially harsh. Or
[00:01:44.079] in 2022, which was especially harsh. Or maybe it's just a generational shift
[00:01:45.429] maybe it's just a generational shift
[00:01:45.439] maybe it's just a generational shift from early Bitcoiner and ETH head years,
[00:01:48.069] from early Bitcoiner and ETH head years,
[00:01:48.079] from early Bitcoiner and ETH head years, which had a lot of optimism for the
[00:01:49.910] which had a lot of optimism for the
[00:01:49.920] which had a lot of optimism for the cryptocurrency space built in, and now
[00:01:51.590] cryptocurrency space built in, and now
[00:01:51.600] cryptocurrency space built in, and now moved to this financial nihilism of
[00:01:52.950] moved to this financial nihilism of
[00:01:52.960] moved to this financial nihilism of memecoin insanity. Even the previous
[00:01:54.630] memecoin insanity. Even the previous
[00:01:54.640] memecoin insanity. Even the previous cycle's NFT wave was characterized by at
[00:01:56.870] cycle's NFT wave was characterized by at
[00:01:56.880] cycle's NFT wave was characterized by at least some good vibes, man. People
[00:01:58.709] least some good vibes, man. People
[00:01:58.719] least some good vibes, man. People generally having some kind of fun doing
[00:02:01.190] generally having some kind of fun doing
[00:02:01.200] generally having some kind of fun doing weird things. Now, what what's the dog
[00:02:04.469] weird things. Now, what what's the dog
[00:02:04.479] weird things. Now, what what's the dog of the day, man? It's just a theory.
[00:02:06.310] of the day, man? It's just a theory.
[00:02:06.320] of the day, man? It's just a theory. But, uh, here's the point that matters.
[00:02:08.229] But, uh, here's the point that matters.
[00:02:08.239] But, uh, here's the point that matters. Whatever the reasons for the pessimism
[00:02:11.350] Whatever the reasons for the pessimism
[00:02:11.360] Whatever the reasons for the pessimism have been, the doomers have been
[00:02:13.510] have been, the doomers have been
[00:02:13.520] have been, the doomers have been consistently wrong. Remember, life's
[00:02:15.430] consistently wrong. Remember, life's
[00:02:15.440] consistently wrong. Remember, life's electric. Life's a vibe. Screw the
[00:02:16.630] electric. Life's a vibe. Screw the
[00:02:16.640] electric. Life's a vibe. Screw the doomers, man. Don't let don't let those
[00:02:17.990] doomers, man. Don't let don't let those
[00:02:18.000] doomers, man. Don't let don't let those bearish vibes end your life. Plus, this
[00:02:19.510] bearish vibes end your life. Plus, this
[00:02:19.520] bearish vibes end your life. Plus, this is where market psychology comes into
[00:02:20.949] is where market psychology comes into
[00:02:20.959] is where market psychology comes into play. If the crowd is certain of one
[00:02:23.510] play. If the crowd is certain of one
[00:02:23.520] play. If the crowd is certain of one particular outcome, guess what? It
[00:02:25.589] particular outcome, guess what? It
[00:02:25.599] particular outcome, guess what? It becomes a lot less likely that that
[00:02:27.510] becomes a lot less likely that that
[00:02:27.520] becomes a lot less likely that that outcome will play out. Somebody has to
[00:02:31.030] outcome will play out. Somebody has to
[00:02:31.040] outcome will play out. Somebody has to be offside. And it's usually most people
[00:02:33.350] be offside. And it's usually most people
[00:02:33.360] be offside. And it's usually most people who are offside. Bull markets seed when
[00:02:35.589] who are offside. Bull markets seed when
[00:02:35.599] who are offside. Bull markets seed when the consensus is doubt and disbelief
[00:02:38.070] the consensus is doubt and disbelief
[00:02:38.080] the consensus is doubt and disbelief just as bare markets emerge from greed
[00:02:41.350] just as bare markets emerge from greed
[00:02:41.360] just as bare markets emerge from greed and euphoria. So then what is the crypto
[00:02:44.070] and euphoria. So then what is the crypto
[00:02:44.080] and euphoria. So then what is the crypto consensus right now that everyone is
[00:02:45.750] consensus right now that everyone is
[00:02:45.760] consensus right now that everyone is wrong about? And what is the contrarian
[00:02:47.190] wrong about? And what is the contrarian
[00:02:47.200] wrong about? And what is the contrarian take? Well, before we dive into that,
[00:02:48.949] take? Well, before we dive into that,
[00:02:48.959] take? Well, before we dive into that, guys, there's a reason that traders keep

[00:03:39.110] Okay. Okay. So, back to this topic here.
[00:03:39.120] Okay. Okay. So, back to this topic here. Right now, basically the most widely
[00:03:41.110] Right now, basically the most widely
[00:03:41.120] Right now, basically the most widely held view is that we top in or around
[00:03:43.110] held view is that we top in or around
[00:03:43.120] held view is that we top in or around October of this year, which I think will
[00:03:44.470] October of this year, which I think will
[00:03:44.480] October of this year, which I think will be a local top for BTC, 150k BTC, some
[00:03:47.990] be a local top for BTC, 150k BTC, some
[00:03:48.000] be a local top for BTC, 150k BTC, some maybe get 7K ETH. We'll see. But that's
[00:03:50.550] maybe get 7K ETH. We'll see. But that's
[00:03:50.560] maybe get 7K ETH. We'll see. But that's going to catch a lot of people off guard
[00:03:52.309] going to catch a lot of people off guard
[00:03:52.319] going to catch a lot of people off guard because that's the 4-year cycle target.
[00:03:55.110] because that's the 4-year cycle target.
[00:03:55.120] because that's the 4-year cycle target. That's the top of tops, right? And sure,
[00:03:56.949] That's the top of tops, right? And sure,
[00:03:56.959] That's the top of tops, right? And sure, look at the cycle so far. And at first
[00:03:58.630] look at the cycle so far. And at first
[00:03:58.640] look at the cycle so far. And at first sight, there's a strong case for that
[00:04:00.070] sight, there's a strong case for that
[00:04:00.080] sight, there's a strong case for that prediction. Okay, but that misses a key
[00:04:02.470] prediction. Okay, but that misses a key
[00:04:02.480] prediction. Okay, but that misses a key point, which is that we've only got
[00:04:04.149] point, which is that we've only got
[00:04:04.159] point, which is that we've only got limited previous data to draw on.
[00:04:06.149] limited previous data to draw on.
[00:04:06.159] limited previous data to draw on. Bitcoin is now incomparable to the coin
[00:04:08.710] Bitcoin is now incomparable to the coin
[00:04:08.720] Bitcoin is now incomparable to the coin that was changing hands almost for free
[00:04:11.589] that was changing hands almost for free
[00:04:11.599] that was changing hands almost for free back in its earliest days. ETH and its
[00:04:13.990] back in its earliest days. ETH and its
[00:04:14.000] back in its earliest days. ETH and its ecosystem today are nothing like ETH
[00:04:16.789] ecosystem today are nothing like ETH
[00:04:16.799] ecosystem today are nothing like ETH back in 2017. And even if you just look
[00:04:20.310] back in 2017. And even if you just look
[00:04:20.320] back in 2017. And even if you just look back to 2021, there has been enormous
[00:04:24.150] back to 2021, there has been enormous
[00:04:24.160] back to 2021, there has been enormous development around Bitcoin, DeFi, stable
[00:04:27.430] development around Bitcoin, DeFi, stable
[00:04:27.440] development around Bitcoin, DeFi, stable coins, the institutional bids and
[00:04:30.230] coins, the institutional bids and
[00:04:30.240] coins, the institutional bids and actually the whole of crypto over the
[00:04:31.990] actually the whole of crypto over the
[00:04:32.000] actually the whole of crypto over the last four years has changed
[00:04:33.510] last four years has changed
[00:04:33.520] last four years has changed dramatically. The ETFs are here, the
[00:04:34.950] dramatically. The ETFs are here, the
[00:04:34.960] dramatically. The ETFs are here, the Treasury companies are here, the

[00:04:39.189] here. Crypto is going mainstream, baby.
[00:04:39.199] here. Crypto is going mainstream, baby. 401ks for cryptos nuts. So, what I'm
[00:04:41.350] 401ks for cryptos nuts. So, what I'm
[00:04:41.360] 401ks for cryptos nuts. So, what I'm talking about here really comes down to
[00:04:42.469] talking about here really comes down to
[00:04:42.479] talking about here really comes down to the idea that crypto is an asset that is
[00:04:44.710] the idea that crypto is an asset that is
[00:04:44.720] the idea that crypto is an asset that is in its maturation phase. Basically, this
[00:04:47.749] in its maturation phase. Basically, this
[00:04:47.759] in its maturation phase. Basically, this is it. We're here. Bitcoin made it.
[00:04:49.990] is it. We're here. Bitcoin made it.
[00:04:50.000] is it. We're here. Bitcoin made it. We're going mainstream right now. It's
[00:04:51.830] We're going mainstream right now. It's
[00:04:51.840] We're going mainstream right now. It's happening. ETH is following close behind
[00:04:53.749] happening. ETH is following close behind
[00:04:53.759] happening. ETH is following close behind with the rest of the crypto industry
[00:04:54.950] with the rest of the crypto industry
[00:04:54.960] with the rest of the crypto industry being dragged up by those leaders. The
[00:04:57.189] being dragged up by those leaders. The
[00:04:57.199] being dragged up by those leaders. The crypto industry as a whole is locked in
[00:04:58.790] crypto industry as a whole is locked in
[00:04:58.800] crypto industry as a whole is locked in and it's here to stay. It's no longer

[00:05:05.189] part of mainstream finance. But just
[00:05:05.199] part of mainstream finance. But just sticking with Bitcoin for a moment, as
[00:05:06.550] sticking with Bitcoin for a moment, as
[00:05:06.560] sticking with Bitcoin for a moment, as that's the leader of the whole industry
[00:05:07.749] that's the leader of the whole industry
[00:05:07.759] that's the leader of the whole industry anyway. BTC is now a global macro asset.
[00:05:10.469] anyway. BTC is now a global macro asset.
[00:05:10.479] anyway. BTC is now a global macro asset. It's comparable with gold. It's the
[00:05:11.990] It's comparable with gold. It's the
[00:05:12.000] It's comparable with gold. It's the sixth largest asset in the world by
[00:05:13.510] sixth largest asset in the world by
[00:05:13.520] sixth largest asset in the world by market cap at the time recording this
[00:05:14.870] market cap at the time recording this
[00:05:14.880] market cap at the time recording this video. It's outpacing the QQQ index,
[00:05:18.469] video. It's outpacing the QQQ index,
[00:05:18.479] video. It's outpacing the QQQ index, right? It's the underlying asset in the
[00:05:20.790] right? It's the underlying asset in the
[00:05:20.800] right? It's the underlying asset in the fastest growing ETF ever, which is Black
[00:05:24.390] fastest growing ETF ever, which is Black
[00:05:24.400] fastest growing ETF ever, which is Black Rockck's Bitcoin ETF. It's on corporate
[00:05:26.390] Rockck's Bitcoin ETF. It's on corporate
[00:05:26.400] Rockck's Bitcoin ETF. It's on corporate balance sheets. It's soon to be in your
[00:05:27.909] balance sheets. It's soon to be in your
[00:05:27.919] balance sheets. It's soon to be in your 401k. Countries are starting to buy it.
[00:05:30.790] 401k. Countries are starting to buy it.
[00:05:30.800] 401k. Countries are starting to buy it. You get the picture. Then there's ETH.
[00:05:33.110] You get the picture. Then there's ETH.
[00:05:33.120] You get the picture. Then there's ETH. Now, maybe you saw that the ETH ETFs
[00:05:34.950] Now, maybe you saw that the ETH ETFs
[00:05:34.960] Now, maybe you saw that the ETH ETFs received over a billion dollars of
[00:05:37.350] received over a billion dollars of
[00:05:37.360] received over a billion dollars of inflows on Monday this week. That's a
[00:05:40.310] inflows on Monday this week. That's a
[00:05:40.320] inflows on Monday this week. That's a big change from basically hoping for a
[00:05:42.390] big change from basically hoping for a
[00:05:42.400] big change from basically hoping for a million dollar day back in January or
[00:05:44.150] million dollar day back in January or
[00:05:44.160] million dollar day back in January or February when Wall Street didn't give a
[00:05:45.830] February when Wall Street didn't give a
[00:05:45.840] February when Wall Street didn't give a crap about ETH. Suddenly, Black Rockck's
[00:05:48.070] crap about ETH. Suddenly, Black Rockck's
[00:05:48.080] crap about ETH. Suddenly, Black Rockck's ETH A became the third fastest ETF ever
[00:05:51.590] ETH A became the third fastest ETF ever
[00:05:51.600] ETH A became the third fastest ETF ever to hit 10 billion in assets under
[00:05:53.189] to hit 10 billion in assets under
[00:05:53.199] to hit 10 billion in assets under management after the top two Bitcoin
[00:05:55.110] management after the top two Bitcoin
[00:05:55.120] management after the top two Bitcoin ETFs. Plus, as with BTC, we've got
[00:05:57.590] ETFs. Plus, as with BTC, we've got
[00:05:57.600] ETFs. Plus, as with BTC, we've got Treasury firms now buying. There's now
[00:05:59.590] Treasury firms now buying. There's now
[00:05:59.600] Treasury firms now buying. There's now 9.9 million ETH locked up in Treasury
[00:06:01.830] 9.9 million ETH locked up in Treasury
[00:06:01.840] 9.9 million ETH locked up in Treasury Company E and uh ETFs combined. That's
[00:06:04.309] Company E and uh ETFs combined. That's
[00:06:04.319] Company E and uh ETFs combined. That's over 8% of the total supply worth $46
[00:06:06.950] over 8% of the total supply worth $46
[00:06:06.960] over 8% of the total supply worth $46 billion. Keep in mind too that one and
[00:06:09.510] billion. Keep in mind too that one and
[00:06:09.520] billion. Keep in mind too that one and three ETH are currently locked up in the
[00:06:11.029] three ETH are currently locked up in the
[00:06:11.039] three ETH are currently locked up in the staking contract. ETH is now the 22nd
[00:06:13.350] staking contract. ETH is now the 22nd
[00:06:13.360] staking contract. ETH is now the 22nd largest asset in the world by market
[00:06:16.309] largest asset in the world by market
[00:06:16.319] largest asset in the world by market cap. Crazy stuff, right? So with Wall
[00:06:18.710] cap. Crazy stuff, right? So with Wall
[00:06:18.720] cap. Crazy stuff, right? So with Wall Street interest and an SEC that's now
[00:06:20.629] Street interest and an SEC that's now

[00:06:30.710] financial influence in the world now
[00:06:30.720] financial influence in the world now shilling crypto regularly. We're going
[00:06:32.390] shilling crypto regularly. We're going
[00:06:32.400] shilling crypto regularly. We're going to go higher guys with pro crypto
[00:06:34.550] to go higher guys with pro crypto
[00:06:34.560] to go higher guys with pro crypto legislation passing in the USA. Crypto
[00:06:36.469] legislation passing in the USA. Crypto
[00:06:36.479] legislation passing in the USA. Crypto is now in uncharted waters. We are in
[00:06:38.309] is now in uncharted waters. We are in
[00:06:38.319] is now in uncharted waters. We are in the big boy phase now and I mean in the
[00:06:40.629] the big boy phase now and I mean in the
[00:06:40.639] the big boy phase now and I mean in the best possible sense. We are in the asset
[00:06:42.870] best possible sense. We are in the asset
[00:06:42.880] best possible sense. We are in the asset maturation phase. So, with all that in
[00:06:44.469] maturation phase. So, with all that in
[00:06:44.479] maturation phase. So, with all that in mind, it just doesn't make that much
[00:06:46.390] mind, it just doesn't make that much
[00:06:46.400] mind, it just doesn't make that much sense to think that cryptos just can
[00:06:48.150] sense to think that cryptos just can
[00:06:48.160] sense to think that cryptos just can continue to follow slavishly along with
[00:06:51.029] continue to follow slavishly along with
[00:06:51.039] continue to follow slavishly along with this four-year cycle idea as it did when
[00:06:53.350] this four-year cycle idea as it did when
[00:06:53.360] this four-year cycle idea as it did when it was an isolated asset class. Now, it
[00:06:55.029] it was an isolated asset class. Now, it
[00:06:55.039] it was an isolated asset class. Now, it remains to be disproven. You have to
[00:06:56.710] remains to be disproven. You have to
[00:06:56.720] remains to be disproven. You have to keep that in mind. And if we do get a
[00:06:58.710] keep that in mind. And if we do get a
[00:06:58.720] keep that in mind. And if we do get a 150 160k top in October, it's going to
[00:07:00.790] 150 160k top in October, it's going to
[00:07:00.800] 150 160k top in October, it's going to catch a lot of people off. We go higher
[00:07:02.070] catch a lot of people off. We go higher
[00:07:02.080] catch a lot of people off. We go higher in 2026. We had a much smaller total
[00:07:04.230] in 2026. We had a much smaller total
[00:07:04.240] in 2026. We had a much smaller total market cap back then and pivoting to
[00:07:06.230] market cap back then and pivoting to
[00:07:06.240] market cap back then and pivoting to long-term swings around the Bitcoin
[00:07:08.070] long-term swings around the Bitcoin
[00:07:08.080] long-term swings around the Bitcoin having when there was still a lot of
[00:07:09.589] having when there was still a lot of
[00:07:09.599] having when there was still a lot of Bitcoin still to be issued. It all made
[00:07:11.749] Bitcoin still to be issued. It all made
[00:07:11.759] Bitcoin still to be issued. It all made sense. But unlike now, 93% of the supply
[00:07:14.070] sense. But unlike now, 93% of the supply
[00:07:14.080] sense. But unlike now, 93% of the supply has already been mined. The ability of
[00:07:15.589] has already been mined. The ability of
[00:07:15.599] has already been mined. The ability of miners to dump in the market and affect
[00:07:17.270] miners to dump in the market and affect
[00:07:17.280] miners to dump in the market and affect the market is diminishing. Old whales
[00:07:19.589] the market is diminishing. Old whales
[00:07:19.599] the market is diminishing. Old whales are capitulating and selling, taking
[00:07:21.110] are capitulating and selling, taking
[00:07:21.120] are capitulating and selling, taking their profits and running away. This all
[00:07:22.870] their profits and running away. This all
[00:07:22.880] their profits and running away. This all suggests then that we need to treat
[00:07:24.150] suggests then that we need to treat
[00:07:24.160] suggests then that we need to treat crypto as more of a mainstream tech
[00:07:26.230] crypto as more of a mainstream tech
[00:07:26.240] crypto as more of a mainstream tech asset in a financial industry in of
[00:07:28.230] asset in a financial industry in of
[00:07:28.240] asset in a financial industry in of itself that will more likely follow
[00:07:29.830] itself that will more likely follow
[00:07:29.840] itself that will more likely follow along with the stock market and consider
[00:07:31.830] along with the stock market and consider
[00:07:31.840] along with the stock market and consider the likelihood, whether you want to
[00:07:33.189] the likelihood, whether you want to
[00:07:33.199] the likelihood, whether you want to accept it or not, of an extended crypto
[00:07:35.189] accept it or not, of an extended crypto
[00:07:35.199] accept it or not, of an extended crypto cycle. looking at all the markets in the
[00:07:37.430] cycle. looking at all the markets in the
[00:07:37.440] cycle. looking at all the markets in the broader macro landscape. We could be in
[00:07:39.110] broader macro landscape. We could be in
[00:07:39.120] broader macro landscape. We could be in for a global top next year and that's
[00:07:42.150] for a global top next year and that's
[00:07:42.160] for a global top next year and that's more relevant than ever for crypto.
[00:07:44.550] more relevant than ever for crypto.
[00:07:44.560] more relevant than ever for crypto. Maybe it comes in Q2. A lot of people
[00:07:46.070] Maybe it comes in Q2. A lot of people
[00:07:46.080] Maybe it comes in Q2. A lot of people been talking about Q2 2026. Not
[00:07:48.070] been talking about Q2 2026. Not
[00:07:48.080] been talking about Q2 2026. Not everybody. It's far from consensus. As
[00:07:49.830] everybody. It's far from consensus. As
[00:07:49.840] everybody. It's far from consensus. As pointed out next by Alec Krueger, these
[00:07:51.430] pointed out next by Alec Krueger, these
[00:07:51.440] pointed out next by Alec Krueger, these Bank of America charts show that
[00:07:52.790] Bank of America charts show that
[00:07:52.800] Bank of America charts show that investor sentiment along with fund
[00:07:54.309] investor sentiment along with fund
[00:07:54.319] investor sentiment along with fund manager deployed cash levels and equity
[00:07:55.990] manager deployed cash levels and equity
[00:07:56.000] manager deployed cash levels and equity allocations are definitely in bullish
[00:07:58.309] allocations are definitely in bullish
[00:07:58.319] allocations are definitely in bullish territory, but are still far off the
[00:08:00.710] territory, but are still far off the
[00:08:00.720] territory, but are still far off the extreme levels that are seen in previous
[00:08:03.510] extreme levels that are seen in previous
[00:08:03.520] extreme levels that are seen in previous market peaks like in 2021 and at other
[00:08:06.230] market peaks like in 2021 and at other
[00:08:06.240] market peaks like in 2021 and at other moments before that when the markets hit
[00:08:08.230] moments before that when the markets hit
[00:08:08.240] moments before that when the markets hit peak euphoria. So we are in the buildup
[00:08:11.830] peak euphoria. So we are in the buildup
[00:08:11.840] peak euphoria. So we are in the buildup phase during which fund managers are
[00:08:14.869] phase during which fund managers are
[00:08:14.879] phase during which fund managers are positioning themselves without yet going
[00:08:17.670] positioning themselves without yet going
[00:08:17.680] positioning themselves without yet going allin. But if Trump pushes the Fed
[00:08:20.390] allin. But if Trump pushes the Fed
[00:08:20.400] allin. But if Trump pushes the Fed towards aggressive easing, which is
[00:08:22.070] towards aggressive easing, which is
[00:08:22.080] towards aggressive easing, which is exactly what he's doing, we should get
[00:08:23.350] exactly what he's doing, we should get
[00:08:23.360] exactly what he's doing, we should get rate cuts in September because labor
[00:08:24.950] rate cuts in September because labor
[00:08:24.960] rate cuts in September because labor markets weaken, inflation's cooled, and
[00:08:26.869] markets weaken, inflation's cooled, and
[00:08:26.879] markets weaken, inflation's cooled, and he's going to put a new guy in in 2026.
[00:08:29.510] he's going to put a new guy in in 2026.
[00:08:29.520] he's going to put a new guy in in 2026. He's clearly looking to get rid of
[00:08:30.869] He's clearly looking to get rid of
[00:08:30.879] He's clearly looking to get rid of Jerome Pal, appoint a governor of the
[00:08:33.190] Jerome Pal, appoint a governor of the
[00:08:33.200] Jerome Pal, appoint a governor of the Fed, a Fed chair that he approves of
[00:08:35.509] Fed, a Fed chair that he approves of
[00:08:35.519] Fed, a Fed chair that he approves of will bring interest rates down
[00:08:37.029] will bring interest rates down
[00:08:37.039] will bring interest rates down dramatically. Then the liquidity that
[00:08:38.709] dramatically. Then the liquidity that
[00:08:38.719] dramatically. Then the liquidity that flows into the markets as a result could
[00:08:40.310] flows into the markets as a result could
[00:08:40.320] flows into the markets as a result could propel us towards full bubble territory
[00:08:42.790] propel us towards full bubble territory
[00:08:42.800] propel us towards full bubble territory in 2026. Remember the key point, crypto
[00:08:45.990] in 2026. Remember the key point, crypto
[00:08:46.000] in 2026. Remember the key point, crypto has come in from the cold, especially
[00:08:47.670] has come in from the cold, especially
[00:08:47.680] has come in from the cold, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum, meaning that
[00:08:49.190] Bitcoin and Ethereum, meaning that
[00:08:49.200] Bitcoin and Ethereum, meaning that institutions can now buy into it. The
[00:08:51.829] institutions can now buy into it. The
[00:08:51.839] institutions can now buy into it. The water's safe. Everybody's jumping in.
[00:08:53.750] water's safe. Everybody's jumping in.
[00:08:53.760] water's safe. Everybody's jumping in. They're driving the hype. The main
[00:08:55.269] They're driving the hype. The main
[00:08:55.279] They're driving the hype. The main characters are people like Tom Lee, Wall
[00:08:56.710] characters are people like Tom Lee, Wall
[00:08:56.720] characters are people like Tom Lee, Wall Street legend, buying 25 billion bucks
[00:08:58.710] Street legend, buying 25 billion bucks
[00:08:58.720] Street legend, buying 25 billion bucks worth of Ethereum. So, we are now in a
[00:09:00.949] worth of Ethereum. So, we are now in a
[00:09:00.959] worth of Ethereum. So, we are now in a risk-on environment for crypto, perhaps
[00:09:03.030] risk-on environment for crypto, perhaps
[00:09:03.040] risk-on environment for crypto, perhaps more than ever before. We are best
[00:09:04.870] more than ever before. We are best
[00:09:04.880] more than ever before. We are best positioned to ride this bubble. It will
[00:09:07.829] positioned to ride this bubble. It will
[00:09:07.839] positioned to ride this bubble. It will be a bubble. It will pop at some point,
[00:09:09.829] be a bubble. It will pop at some point,
[00:09:09.839] be a bubble. It will pop at some point, but the popping probably doesn't come in
[00:09:12.150] but the popping probably doesn't come in
[00:09:12.160] but the popping probably doesn't come in October. again, local peak. Sure, that's
[00:09:15.750] October. again, local peak. Sure, that's
[00:09:15.760] October. again, local peak. Sure, that's going to catch a lot of people off
[00:09:16.790] going to catch a lot of people off
[00:09:16.800] going to catch a lot of people off guard. The move back from 150k to 110 is
[00:09:19.509] guard. The move back from 150k to 110 is
[00:09:19.519] guard. The move back from 150k to 110 is going to break everyone's brains, but
[00:09:21.030] going to break everyone's brains, but
[00:09:21.040] going to break everyone's brains, but you'll be ready for it when it comes.
[00:09:23.110] you'll be ready for it when it comes.
[00:09:23.120] you'll be ready for it when it comes. Okay? And the likelihood is that we will
[00:09:25.430] Okay? And the likelihood is that we will
[00:09:25.440] Okay? And the likelihood is that we will continue pushing with global M2 and
[00:09:27.590] continue pushing with global M2 and
[00:09:27.600] continue pushing with global M2 and rising liquidity and easing rates and
[00:09:29.430] rising liquidity and easing rates and

[00:09:31.030] the business cycle continuing to expand
[00:09:31.040] the business cycle continuing to expand and all that stuff well into 2026. Maybe
[00:09:33.750] and all that stuff well into 2026. Maybe
[00:09:33.760] and all that stuff well into 2026. Maybe all this data is wrong. Maybe the
[00:09:35.430] all this data is wrong. Maybe the
[00:09:35.440] all this data is wrong. Maybe the four-year cycle wins. We're going to
[00:09:36.949] four-year cycle wins. We're going to
[00:09:36.959] four-year cycle wins. We're going to find out by the end of the year. But be
[00:09:38.630] find out by the end of the year. But be
[00:09:38.640] find out by the end of the year. But be open to other possibilities, okay? I
[00:09:40.870] open to other possibilities, okay? I
[00:09:40.880] open to other possibilities, okay? I don't have a crystal ball. You don't
[00:09:42.230] don't have a crystal ball. You don't
