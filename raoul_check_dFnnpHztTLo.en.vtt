is<00:08:12.400><c> as</c><00:08:12.639><c> populations</c><00:08:13.120><c> get</c><00:08:13.360><c> older,</c><00:08:13.599><c> they</c><00:08:13.840><c> become</c>

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
is as populations get older, they become
 

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.390 align:start position:0%
is as populations get older, they become

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
